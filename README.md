This repository contains my notebooks for the TIL AI Camp 2019 organized by DSTA. It was an AI competition, which involved classifying human poses, with 15 different classes. 
I tried to do transfer learning and leverage on the pre-trained model, InceptionV3, for feature extraction and using the representations as input into a new model. Thereafter, to increase the accuracy, I applied fine-tuning to the top layers of the pre-trained model. 
However, for my team's final approach, we decided to use the existing AlphaPose for pose estimation prior to doing classfication.
Eventually, my team finished within the top 5 teams and we won a merit award.
